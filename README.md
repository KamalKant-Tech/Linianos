Interview Question Print Number &amp; Linio, IT , Linianos
## Requirements

Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Linio". For multiples of 5 print "IT". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "Linianos".

But here's the catch: you can use only one `if`. No multiple branches, ternary operators or `else`.

Conver the following features in your program:

  - Maximum of 1 if
  - You can't use `else`, `else if` or ternary
  - Unit tests
  - Feel free to apply your SOLID knowledge
  
### Prerequisite

- php-cli or xampp/lamp
- PHP 7.1, preferred 7.1.6

```
    php Solution.php
